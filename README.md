A simple 2D game made with C++ and SFML library.

To compile via Visual Studio or some other compiler SFML libraries must be linked. 
You can install the game using setup.exe in Installation Setup folder.
There are lots of cardinal bugs and code isn't beautiful but it was a very first project made for programming in C++ classes.
